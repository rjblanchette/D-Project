THE COHERENCE DIVIDEND — MANIFESTO v1.1
A Framework for Shared Prosperity in the Age of Intelligent Systems
We stand at the moment when intelligence becomes a general-purpose capability of the economy.
Artificial intelligence is accelerating discovery, compressing time, transforming industries, and reshaping the way value is created. But the systems we use to distribute that value were built for a different era—an era before cognitive automation, before autonomous research, before supply chains that learn.
Progress is accelerating, but our social and economic institutions still move at human speed.
This gap—between the pace of technology and the pace of governance—is where inequality widens, trust erodes, and social cohesion fractures. If we do nothing, the benefits of AI will flow to those who control the tools, not to those who generate the demand, provide the data, and depend on the stability of a functioning society.
The Coherence Dividend is a response to this gap.
It is a simple proposal with far-reaching consequences:
measure the economic surplus generated by AI, correct it for time-lag and intangible investments, and share a portion of that surplus with the society that makes it possible.
This is not charity.
Not compensation.
Not a welfare mechanism.
It is a recognition that when value is created collectively, its returns should reinforce collective stability.

I. AI is a General Purpose Technology — and With It Comes Responsibility
Every major technological leap—steam, electricity, computing—produced extraordinary gains but also dislocation, extraction, and inequality. AI is different in scale, speed, and depth:
    • It accelerates discovery itself.
    • It compresses entire workflows into single steps.
    • It automates not just tasks, but learning.
When intelligence becomes an input factor, surplus becomes exponential, and without guardrails, so does concentration.
The Coherence Dividend asserts a basic principle:
We can embrace progress without allowing destabilizing concentrations of power.

II. Surplus Must Be Measured Honestly
AI doesn’t create value all at once.
The early years produce confusion, cost, and reorganization before uplift emerges. This is the Productivity J-Curve, now integrated in v1.3 of the Dividend model:
    • Early adoption → lower measured surplus
    • Inflection → rapid gains
    • Maturity → stabilized productivity
The Coherence Dividend acknowledges this temporal reality.
We do not punish companies during the dip; we measure them fairly across the entire adoption curve.
This makes the framework credible, non-punitive, and economically grounded.

III. Distribution is Not Redistribution
The Dividend does not confiscate wealth.
It does not tax innovation.
It does not punish success.
Instead, it relies on a principle found in physics, ecology, and healthy markets:
Systems remain stable when gains are shared across their interdependent parts.
The Dividend simply directs a portion of AI-induced surplus toward:
    • resilience,
    • public infrastructure,
    • transition pathways,
    • and long-term prosperity.
If countries, cities, or institutions choose to allocate their Dividend to services, savings, or charity—that is their choice.
The D-Project never dictates outcomes, only the measurement and structure.

IV. The Architecture Must Resist Capture
We have learned from every major carbon, financial, and data initiative:
wherever value flows, manipulation follows.
The D-Project incorporates:
    • Boundary rules (who is included, and why)
    • Anti-capture architecture (no single actor dominates)
    • External technical legitimacy layers (independent validation)
    • Global comparability rules (preventing arbitrage)
These ensure the Dividend is robust, neutral, and tamper-resistant—a system designed for integrity, not convenience.

V. The Dividend Strengthens Markets, Not Replaces Them
Markets thrive when:
    • risk is manageable,
    • demand is stable,
    • transitions are supported,
    • and social trust is intact.
AI, if left unstructured, threatens all four.
The Dividend is not an alternative to markets—it is their maintenance system.
It keeps the economy coherent while AI accelerates beyond traditional frameworks.
It is a way to modernize capitalism, not abandon it.

VI. The Dividend Is a Bridge to the Future Economy
Over the next century, AI will trigger successive waves of transformation:
    1. Cognitive automation
    2. Physical automation
    3. Synthetic biology
    4. Energy abundance
    5. Autonomous infrastructure
    6. Post-labor macroeconomics
Each wave generates surplus, and each wave reshapes society’s balance.
The Coherence Dividend ensures that as each GPT layer emerges, prosperity compounds rather than concentrates, and that society evolves at the pace of technology—not behind it.

VII. A Call to Collective Stewardship
We cannot slow progress.
We cannot freeze innovation.
But we can choose how we integrate it into the fabric of society.
The Coherence Dividend is a declaration:
That prosperity is strongest when shared.
That progress is safest when anchored.
That the future belongs to all who help build it.
It is not a tax.
It is not redistribution.
It is not ideology.
It is stewardship.
It is responsibility.
It is coherence.

VIII. The Manifesto’s Promise
AI will reshape economies for a century.
The Dividend ensures we shape society in parallel.
The future will not be defined by the speed of our machines,
but by the wisdom of our structures.
The Coherence Dividend is the structure.
The D-Project is its engine.
And together, they offer a future where progress does not fracture us—
it binds us.
