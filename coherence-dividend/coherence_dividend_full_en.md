# The Coherence Dividend (Full Public Note)

Modern systems create value in two ways:

- through direct productivity gains
- through improvements in how systems work together

The **Coherence Dividend** is a way to describe and value the second.

It is the surplus that appears when:

- frictions decrease
- handovers improve
- information flows more smoothly
- institutions align around shared processes
- citizens encounter fewer contradictions

This note explains the concept in detail and shows why coherence is a form of value in its own right.
