# Why This Matters Now (Public Version)

We live in a period where value is created faster than institutions can easily track or explain it.

New tools, infrastructures, and forms of organisation produce surplus at increasing speed.  
But our measurement systems, narratives, and governance structures lag behind.

When surplus remains invisible:

- citizens feel uncertainty
- benefits appear to concentrate without explanation
- trust in institutions erodes
- political tension rises

Making surplus and coherence visible is not a luxury.  
It is a stabilising function.

The Coherence Dividend matters now because it offers:

- a calm, structural way to talk about value
- a shared frame for citizens, institutions, and researchers
- a way to connect technological and organisational progress with everyday experience

Clarity is the first step toward stability.
