# D-Project — Canonical Public Repository
**Version 1.0 • Open • Transparent • Verifiable**

This repository contains the official, authoritative, and version-controlled architecture of the **D-Project**, a public governance framework for fair AI surplus distribution.

## Source of Truth
All canonical materials live in the `/docs` folder.
Do not trust interpretations outside this repository.

## Contents
- Full Architecture (DProject_v1.0.md)

The D-Project is intentionally structured to prevent:
- corporate capture
- political capture
- philanthropic capture
- technocratic capture
- bureaucratic capture

# **DProject — AI Dividend Framework**

*A citizen-led research architecture for measuring, modeling, and redistributing AI-derived surplus.*

---

## **Purpose**

The DProject is an independent research initiative focused on the development of a concrete, auditable, and institution-ready framework for the **AI Dividend**—the redistribution of productivity surplus generated by artificial intelligence.

This repository contains the **technical, analytical, and publication-ready artefacts** supporting the project:

* quantitative models
* policy drafts
* prompt and template libraries
* outreach material
* reproducible scripts
* finalized documents

It mirrors the structure of the internal OneNote research notebook and is designed for clarity, stability, and traceability.

---

## **Core Idea: AI-Derived Surplus**

At the center of the DProject is a measurable surplus equation:

```
AI-Derived Surplus = (Post-AI Profit – Baseline Profit – AI Costs)
```

When applied rigorously at the firm or sector level, this enables:

* transparent surplus measurement
* fair redistribution policy
* accountability to workers, citizens, and public institutions
* empirical grounding for future AI governance

The project expands this into a full policy system across six pillars:
Efficiency · Redistribution · Policy · Taxation · Partnerships · New Economic Models

---

## **Repository Structure**

The repository mirrors the 10-section DProject architecture for intuitive cross-reference with OneNote:

```
00-Dashboard/      → Project overview, operations manual, navigation
01-Context/        → Thesis, background research, OECD/IMF synthesis
02-Efficiency/     → Productivity uplift, surplus definition, empirical evidence
03-Redistribution/ → Dividend mechanisms, funds, UBI analogies
04-Policy/         → AI Impact Statements, reporting rules, governance
05-Taxation/       → AISA, payroll shift credit, automation levy design
06-Partnerships/   → Public-private models, learning systems, open stacks
07-NewModels/      → AI social wealth funds, time dividend, co-ownership
08-Modeling/       → Scripts, data schemas, case studies (e.g., Sanofi)
09-Outreach/       → Policy briefs, letters, public comms, article drafts
10-Reflection/     → Meta-notes, methodology, design reasoning

templates/         → Markdown templates for briefs, articles, outreach
prompts/           → Prompt libraries for policy/public/architect/critic modes
scripts/           → Utility scripts (OneNote export, PDF pipeline)
docs/              → Diagrams, infographics, public-ready artefacts
```

Only **stable, reusable, or reproducible** content is stored here.

## **Branching Model**

Branches follow the section-based naming convention:

```
NN-sectionname-short-description
```

Examples:

* `02-efficiency-surplus-model-v1`
* `08-modeling-surplus-scripts-v2`
* `09-outreach-oecd-brief-v1`

This allows clean separation of concerns and easy tracking of work streams.

---

## **Commit Convention**

All commits follow the project’s structured log format:

```
[NN-SectionName] Action: short description
```

Examples:

* `[02-Efficiency] Add core surplus definition and empirical notes`
* `[08-Modeling] Add surplus calculator script and test dataset`
* `[09-Outreach] Draft IMF outreach letter (EN)`

This ensures commits are traceable to specific project areas.

---

## **Collaboration & Contributions**

This project is open to collaboration with researchers, economists, technologists, and public institutions.

The workflow:

1. **Fork or branch** from the relevant section.
2. Commit changes using the standard convention.
3. Submit a **pull request** referencing:

   * section
   * purpose
   * relevant DProject pillar
4. Discussion and integration follow the project’s methodological principles:
   clarity • coherence • reproducibility • shared public benefit.

A full `CONTRIBUTING.md` is available in the root directory.

---

## **Modeling & Reproducibility**

All quantitative models (Python scripts, schemas, case studies, and reporting tools) live under:

```
/08-Modeling/
```

These implement the AI surplus equation and support:

* firm-level audits
* sectoral modeling
* policy scenario analysis
* transparency dashboards

Scripts are written to be:

* auditable
* modular
* dependency-light
* easy to integrate into Jupyter or policy simulation pipelines

---

## **Templates & Prompt Libraries**

The project maintains its own **prompt library** and **template set** for structured generation:

* policy briefs (OECD/IMF style)
* public articles (accessible narrative formats)
* outreach letters (institutional engagement)
* modeling explanations

Stored here:

```
/templates/
/prompts/
```

These ensure replicable outputs and consistent tone.
