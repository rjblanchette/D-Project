# Note from the Lab — The Transition (v1.3)

This note explains why the D-Project moved from an AI-specific framing to a universal surplus and coherence architecture.

Key points:
- surplus existed before any specific technology wave
- AI and other tools simply make the underlying gap visible
- a universal architecture is more stable, more durable, and more useful
