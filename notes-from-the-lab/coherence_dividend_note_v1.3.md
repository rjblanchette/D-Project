# Note from the Lab — The Coherence Dividend (v1.3)

This note explores the Coherence Dividend as a practical concept:

- why it was formulated
- how it differs from productivity
- how it links to structural surplus

It is written for readers who want more depth than the manifesto, but without technical metrics.
