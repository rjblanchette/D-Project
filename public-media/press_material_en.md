# D-Project — Press Summary (EN)

**Short description**

The D-Project is a framework for making surplus and coherence visible in advanced societies.

It does not focus on any single technology. Instead, it looks at how modern systems — public and private — generate surplus value and how better coordination can turn that surplus into stability and shared benefit.

**Key ideas**

- Surplus has always existed, but it has often been invisible.
- Coherence — systems working well together — is a form of value.
- The Coherence Dividend describes the surplus created by improved coordination.
- The D-Project is not a tax scheme or a redistribution ideology.
- It is a structural approach to visibility, stability, and civic trust.

The project is developed from Switzerland, with an open, research-oriented approach and public, bilingual documentation.
