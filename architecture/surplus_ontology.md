# Surplus Ontology (Public Overview)

The D-Project distinguishes three broad forms of surplus:

## 1. Operational Surplus

Surplus generated when systems perform tasks more efficiently than their established baseline.

Examples:
- lower energy use per unit
- reduced processing time
- fewer resources required for the same output

This surplus is direct and often visible inside organisations, but rarely surfaced at the societal level.

## 2. Informational Surplus

Surplus created when information becomes:

- more accurate
- more accessible
- less fragmented
- less redundant

This reduces errors, misalignment, and delays.

Informational surplus is crucial for:
- effective decision-making
- reliable services
- trust between institutions and citizens

## 3. Structural Surplus

Surplus that appears when systems become more coherent:

- better coordination across institutions
- smoother handovers between actors
- alignment between sectors (e.g., health, education, labor, industry)
- fewer bottlenecks and conflicts between rules

Structural surplus is closely linked to the **Coherence Dividend**:  
it is the value created when a system as a whole works better together.

These categories are conceptual.  
The internal metrics, formulas, and governance rules that operate on them are not part of this public repository.
