# Coherence Framework (Public Overview)

The Coherence Framework describes how alignment across systems creates measurable value.

## Key Dimensions of Coherence

- **Flow of Information**  
  Are institutions and actors working with consistent, timely information?

- **Process Alignment**  
  Do workflows between organisations fit together, or do they generate friction and duplication?

- **Predictability**  
  Can citizens and organisations reliably anticipate how systems will respond?

- **Responsiveness**  
  Can systems adapt coherently when conditions change?

- **Trust and Legibility**  
  Do people understand how decisions are made and where responsibilities lie?

## Outputs of Coherence

When coherence increases, societies experience:

- fewer administrative dead-ends
- fewer contradictions between institutions
- faster, more reliable services
- smoother crisis response
- more stable expectations

This is captured through the idea of the **Coherence Dividend** —  
the surplus that arises from better coordination and alignment.

The detailed metrics used to quantify coherence (NCC, SIL, ICF) belong to the internal governance layer and are not published here.
