# Architecture Overview (v1.3)

The D-Project architecture rests on three core layers:

1. **Surplus Visibility Layer**  
   Identifies surplus as a distinct category of value, separate from wages, taxes, profits, and transfers.

2. **Coherence Layer**  
   Describes how improvements in coordination, information flow, and alignment generate system-level value.

3. **Governance Interface (Public Side)**  
   Explains how surplus visibility and coherence concepts can be used by institutions, without exposing internal governance rules.

This repository documents the **public-facing description** of these layers, not the internal metrics or algorithms.

The architecture is:
- technology-agnostic
- sector-agnostic
- compatible with multiple governance models
