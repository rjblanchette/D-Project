**© 2025 RJ Blanchette. All rights reserved.**
**D-Project™ Intellectual Property Framework**

This document defines the official trademarks associated with the **D-Project / Coherence Dividend** ecosystem and the rules governing their permitted use.

Trademarks protect the **identity**, **integrity**, and **public trust** of the system.
The names listed below refer to specific governance, surplus measurement, and institutional-design frameworks developed by **RJ Blanchette**.

---

#  **1. Registered or Claiming For Trademark Protection**

The following names and marks are trademarked or reserved for trademark protection:

* **D-Project™**
* **The D-Project™ Framework**
* **Coherence Dividend™**
* **National Coherence Coefficient™ (NCC™)**
* **System Integrity Loop™ (SIL™)**
* **ΔS – AI Surplus Metric™**
* **Coherence Pathways™**
* **International Comparability Framework™ (ICF™)**

These terms identify **unique governance and surplus-distribution models** and should not be used generically.

---

#  **2. Purpose of the Trademarks**

Trademarks ensure that:

* the public is not misled by inaccurate or distorted versions
* governments, firms, or institutions cannot publish falsified or politicized variants
* academic and policy communities can rely on consistent definitions
* the integrity of the architecture is preserved across jurisdictions
* derivative work does not confuse or misrepresent the official model

Trademarks protect the **identity of the standard**, not the underlying ideas.

---

#  **3. Allowed Use (With Attribution)**

The following uses are **permitted**, provided that attribution is maintained and the usage does **not** imply endorsement:

### Academic research

### Policy analysis

### Non-commercial teaching & education

### Descriptive reference (“the D-Project™ proposes…”)

### Critique, debate, commentary

### Open-source implementations of the equations (MIT-licensed portion)

Required attribution format:

```
“D-Project™ / Coherence Dividend™ framework by RJ Blanchette (2025).”
```

---

# **4. Prohibited Use (Without Explicit Written Permission)**

The following uses are *not allowed* without prior permission from
**RJ Blanchette**:

### Creation of alternative governance frameworks using the same names

### Distribution of modified or distorted versions under these names

### Use in commercial products (software, consulting, training, platforms)

### Use by governments or institutions as official policy frameworks

### Certification, accreditation, or compliance services

### Use of the terms in branding, logos, or product names

### Use in political campaigns or lobbying

### Any implication of partnership, endorsement, or official status

These are **protected conceptual identities** and must remain under unified authorship and governance for the system to preserve legitimacy.

---

# **5. Derivative Work Rules**

Derivative systems **may not**:

* use the protected names
* reuse the architecture while implying equivalence
* fork governance layers without changing names
* present altered versions as “official”
* create confusingly similar names (e.g., “D-Project 2,” “Coherence Income,” etc.)

Derivatives **may**:

* build on open technical materials (MIT-licensed components)
* create new frameworks inspired by the ideas
* use non-proprietary formulas with attribution
* run simulations or models for research
* analyze or critique the architecture

But the **brand and identity remain protected**.

---

# **6. Interaction With Licensing**

Trademarks interact with your hybrid license:

* **MIT (Part 1)**: free use of formulas, code, computational logic
* **CC BY-NC (Part 2)**: non-commercial use of documentation
* **Proprietary (Part 3)**: governance rules + standards cannot be altered

Trademarks protect **the names**, independent of licenses.

If a user respects copyright but misuses the trademark, this file governs the violation.

---

# **7. Guidance for Contributors**

Contributors must agree to:

* use trademarked terms correctly
* avoid derivative names
* not imply endorsement
* avoid introducing governance changes requiring trademarked labels
* follow the **Contributor Covenant** (see CONTRIBUTING.md)

This ensures architectural consistency and public trust.

---

# **8. Guidance for Institutions**

Institutions wishing to:

* adopt
* evaluate
* pilot
* implement
* certify
* align with
* benchmark against

…the D-Project must obtain **written permission** and possibly an MOU or licensing agreement.

This applies to:

* governments
* NGOs
* companies
* international organizations
* academic research centers

Institutional use involves governance standards and therefore falls under proprietary protection.
