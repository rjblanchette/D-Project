How to communicate the D-Project to policymakers, journalists, and the public.

---

## 1. Core Narrative

AI accelerates faster than institutions can adapt → instability.
AI surplus is real but unshared → inequality.
Society co-invests → deserves a co-return.

### Tagline:
**“Shared prosperity in the age of AI — not concentrated acceleration.”**

## 2. Messaging Pillars

### 2.1 Fairness
AI is trained on society; society receives a share.

### 2.2 Stability
Shared surplus reduces backlash and polarization.

### 2.3 Legitimacy
Transparent, multi-stakeholder, verifiable governance.

### 2.4 Non-Tax Approach
This is not a tax → it is structural co-investment.
