# README — /docs Directory
### Canonical Documentation Layer — D-Project v1.0

This folder contains the **official, authoritative, and version-controlled documents** defining the D-Project governance architecture.

Everything in this directory is **canonical**.
Everything outside it is **non-authoritative** unless explicitly versioned and referenced.

---

## Purpose of This Directory

The `/docs` folder serves as the **single source of truth** for:

- the full governance architecture
- math spine
- legitimacy logic
- anti-capture mechanisms
- boundary and allocation models
- implementation roadmap
- public verification tools
- foundational statements

This is where journalists, policymakers, auditors, and researchers verify correctness.

If a file is not present here (or referenced by tag),
**it is not part of the D-Project.**

## Verification Instructions

To verify any public claim about the D-Project:

1. Check whether the file exists in this directory.
2. Confirm the version tag (e.g., **v1.0**).
3. Validate governance, boundaries, equations, and allocation rules.
4. Compare any external description with the canonical text.

If an external description does not match these files, it is **not canonical**.

---

## Versioning Policy

- All updates must be recorded in **CHANGELOG.md**
- New versions must be tagged (e.g., `v1.1`, `v1.2`)
- Version increments require validation across the legitimacy stack
- Deprecated content remains visible in Git history

---

## Integrity Rules

- No document in this directory may be modified without:
  - proper versioning
  - justification
  - validation
  - an entry in CHANGELOG.md

- No proprietary or privately funded modifications permitted
- No closed-source forks may be represented as canonical
- This directory forms part of the **anti-capture surface** of the D-Project
