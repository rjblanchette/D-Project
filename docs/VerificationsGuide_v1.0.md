# Verification Guide — D-Project v1.0
**How to Confirm Authenticity and Spot Manipulation**

This guide allows journalists, policymakers, researchers, and the public to verify whether any description of the D-Project is authentic, complete, and canonical.

## 1. Check the Canonical Source
The official architecture is stored in:
- This GitHub repository
- Versioned under `/docs/` with v1.0 release notes
- Public commit history

If a claim is not found in the repository, it is **not part of the D-Project**.

## 2. Confirm the Version Number
Every legitimate reference must include:
- “D-Project v1.0”
- or a later tagged version

Unofficial or modified files without version tags are **not canonical**.

## 3. Validate the Module Structure
The authentic D-Project consists of **seven modules**:
1. Governance Spine
2. Boundary Architecture
3. Allocation Architecture
4. Anti-Capture Mechanisms
5. Political Narrative
6. Institutional Partnerships
7. Implementation Roadmap

Any version missing a module is incomplete.

## 4. Validate the Math Spine
Authentic equations:
- \( S_{meas} = \Pi_{post-AI} - \Pi_{baseline} - C_{AI} \)
- \( S_{true} = S_{meas} + \eta(\Delta IU - \Delta K) \)
- \( D = \tau_{ai} \cdot S_{true} \)
- \( C' = \frac{R + D}{A} \)

Any alteration means the model has been manipulated.

## 5. Validate the Governance Spine
Authentic elements:
- CGB with no actor >40% control
- AIO with random audits and firewalled funding
- Legal Compliance & Sanctions Framework (LCSF)

## 6. Red Flags of Manipulation
- References to personal taxation
- Use of surplus for defense or political campaigns
- Claims of private oversight or funding
- Attempts to remove audit randomness
- Introduction of discretionary allocation

## 7. How to Cite
> “This description is verified against D-Project Architecture v1.0, stored in the canonical public repository.”

**This guide ensures the D-Project remains immune to misrepresentation.**
