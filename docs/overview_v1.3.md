# D-Project — v1.3  
Document: Overview  
Status: Public Technical Documentation  
License: Three-Part License (Measurement · Governance · Integrity)

## Alignment
This document aligns with:
• Six-Pillar Framework  
• Ten-Section D-Project Architecture  
• Surplus & Coherence Equations (ΔS, C’, J-Curve v1.3)  
• NCC + SIL Integrity Layer  
• International Comparability Framework (ICF)

## Protected Boundaries
This document does not modify:
– ΔS formula  
– Coherence equation (C → C’)  
– Pathways (C/I/R)  
– NCC or SIL definitions  
– Steps 0–10  
– Redistribution or political interpretation  

# 1. Purpose
The D-Project establishes a global, institution-grade framework for **measuring**, **interpreting**, and **governing** AI-generated economic surplus.  
It is not policy, taxation, or redistribution.  
It is **economic infrastructure**: a measurement and coherence standard.

# 2. Core Problem: The Visibility Gap
AI produces value that national accounts cannot currently measure with fidelity.

# 3. Three-Domain Framework
1. Measurement — ΔS  
2. Coherence — C’  
3. Integrity — NCC + SIL

# 4. Global Role
The D-Project provides comparable measurement, stability, transparency, and governance integrity.
