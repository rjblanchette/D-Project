# Foundational Statement — D-Project v1.0
**Canonical Public Release • Version 1.0**

The D-Project is a public governance framework that ensures AI-generated economic surplus is measured accurately, distributed fairly, and protected from political or corporate capture.

It introduces a new institutional layer designed to maintain democratic stability and shared prosperity in an era of accelerating AI productivity.

## Core Principles
1. **Co-Investment Return**
   Society co-creates the value → society receives a share.
2. **Open Architecture**
   The system is fully public, transparent, and version-controlled.
3. **Anti-Capture by Design**
   The governance spine prevents domination by any single actor.
4. **Legitimacy Through Distribution**
   Methodological, procedural, and social legitimacy are embedded structurally.
5. **Fairness Without Taxation**
   This is not a tax, not philanthropy, not welfare — it is structural equity.
