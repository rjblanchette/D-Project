# Anti-Capture Architecture — D-Project v1.0

The D-Project is intentionally designed to resist capture from all major vectors.

---

## 1. Capture Types Addressed
- Corporate capture
- Political capture
- Technocratic capture
- Philanthropic capture
- Bureaucratic capture

---

## 2. Structural Defenses

### 2.1 Immutable Base Equations
Cannot be modified without multi-actor approval + external validation.

### 2.2 Methodological Transparency
Open formulas, public method repository.

### 2.3 Randomized Audits
Hard to predict, impossible to bribe.

### 2.4 Firewalled Funding
Oversight bodies cannot be privately funded.

### 2.5 Term Limits & Rotation
No entrenched power centers.

### 2.6 Multi-Anchor Validation
ISO, OECD, UNDP, Stanford, etc.

---

## 3. Disallowed Actions
- Private funding of oversight
- Proprietary math
- One-actor control
- Allocation discretion
- Hidden modifications

---

**Anti-capture is baked into the architecture — not dependent on trust.**
